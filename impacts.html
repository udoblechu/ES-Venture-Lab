          <p> My journey with ES International began in secondary school through its teens arm, SLADDS, where I developed strong public speaking, debating, and leadership skills, serving as Zonal President over several schools an experience that shaped my confidence, communication, and sense of responsibility. Beyond leadership, ES International also introduced me to tech, giving me my first exposure and solid foundation in UI/UX design, which sparked my passion for design.

          <p>My journey through the Senior Literary and Debating Drama Society (SLADDS), culminating in my role as Zonal President, was a defining experience that shaped my leadership and intellectual growth by sharpening my critical thinking, analytical ability, and perspective through diverse narratives. Serving in this role gave me hands-on executive experience in planning, coordination, delegation, and large scale execution, while strengthening my strategic leadership, persuasive communication, and management skills. SLADDS also ignited my poetry journey, blending analytical depth with creative expression, making it more than a society but a true training ground that continues to guide my success.</p>

          <p>Being a member of the SLADDS Club as a teenager opened me to countless opportunities and introduced me to my first set of mentors. It was a truly transformative experience the exposure and leadership skills I gained continue to set me apart wherever I find myself, even nearly a decade later. I would confidently say that SLADDS is a solid foundation for anyone who refuses to settle for an average life.</p>
